# SpendFlow Ad Implementation Strategy

## Recommended Ad Placements

### 1. In-Content Ad (Primary Revenue Driver)
- **Location**: After the first few transactions in the feed
- **Format**: Medium Rectangle (300x250)
- **Why**: High visibility without being intrusive, performs well in content feeds
- **Example**: 
  ```
  [Transaction 1]
  [Transaction 2]
  [Ad - Sponsored Content]
  [Transaction 3]
  ```

### 2. Sidebar Ad (Desktop Only)
- **Location**: Right sidebar, below quick actions
- **Format**: Skyscraper (160x600) or Square (250x250)
- **Why**: Good visibility without interfering with main content

### 3. Bottom Banner (Secondary Revenue)
- **Location**: Above the footer
- **Format**: Leaderboard (728x90) or Medium Rectangle (300x250)
- **Why**: Captures user attention before they leave the page

### 4. Native Ad in Transaction List
- **Location**: Every 5-7 transactions
- **Format**: Native ad matching transaction list styling

## Ad Network Recommendations

1. **Google AdSense** (Best for content sites)
   - Easy to implement
   - Good fill rates
   - Reliable payments

   - Competitive rates for finance vertical

3. **AdThrive** (If you have significant traffic)

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Loading Strategy**
   - Lazy load ads below the fold
   - Use intersection observer for better performance

2. **User Experience**
   - Clearly label ads as "Sponsored" or "Advertisement"
   - Ensure ads don't cover important content
   - No auto-playing video/audio ads

3. **Performance**
   - Set size attributes to prevent layout shifts
   - Use `loading="lazy"` for below-the-fold ads
   - Consider using a placeholder for ad loading

4. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Use responsive ad units
   - Consider sticky bottom banners for mobile
   - Test touch targets (min 44x44px)
