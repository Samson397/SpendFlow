## ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION BEFORE DEPLOY:**

### 1. **Environment Variables** 🔴 CRITICAL
```bash
# Create .env.local file with:
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 2. **Firebase Security Rules** 🔴 CRITICAL
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /cards/{cardId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    match /transactions/{transactionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    match /recurringExpenses/{expenseId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. **Build Errors** ⚠️ MEDIUM
Current TypeScript errors:
- `Card` type missing `name` and `lastFour` in some places
- `Transaction` type has extra fields in create

**Fix:** Already added to types, but may need to rebuild

### 4. **Missing Features** ⚠️ MEDIUM
- No edit/delete for transactions (only cards)
- No search functionality
- No export functionality
- No settings page

### 5. **Auto-Payment System** ⚠️ LOW
- Code is ready but needs cron job setup
- Requires server-side execution
- Not critical for initial launch

---

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Steps:

### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
```bash
# 1. Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# 2. Add your Firebase config
# Edit .env.local with your values
```

### **Step 2: Build Test**
```bash
# Test if the app builds successfully
npm run build

# If errors, fix them before deploying
```

### **Step 3: Firebase Setup**
```bash
# 1. Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# 2. Initialize default categories (optional)
# Run this once in your app after first user signup
```

### **Step 4: Vercel Deployment**
```bash
# Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel
vercel

# Option 2: Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
# - Push to GitHub
# - Import project in Vercel dashboard
# - Add environment variables
# - Deploy
```

---

## 🎯 Deployment Options:

### **Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)**
✅ Best for Next.js
✅ Free tier available
✅ Auto-deployments from Git
✅ Easy environment variables

**Steps:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to vercel.com
3. Import repository
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy!

### **Option 2: Netlify**
✅ Free tier available
✅ Good for static sites
⚠️ May need configuration for Next.js

### **Option 3: Firebase Hosting**
✅ Already using Firebase
✅ Good integration
⚠️ Requires Firebase CLI setup
