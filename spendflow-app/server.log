 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /Users/samson/package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.

The export CrownIcon was not found in module [project]/Desktop/SpendFlow/spendflow-app/node_modules/@heroicons/react/24/outline/esm/index.js [app-client] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import ChevronUpIcon?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.

The export CrownIcon was not found in module [project]/Desktop/SpendFlow/spendflow-app/node_modules/@heroicons/react/24/outline/esm/index.js [app-ssr] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import ChevronUpIcon?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
